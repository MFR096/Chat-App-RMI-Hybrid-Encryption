Overview
This chat application provides secure communication between users by employing a hybrid cryptosystem, combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques. The system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between users.

Features
Secure Messaging: Messages are encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a randomly generated symmetric key for each conversation.
Key Exchange: Symmetric keys are securely exchanged using RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) asymmetric encryption between users.
Integrity Check: Ensures data integrity through SHA-256 hashing for each message.
IV Implementation: Uses Initialization Vectors (IVs) to enhance encryption security and prevent pattern repetitio
